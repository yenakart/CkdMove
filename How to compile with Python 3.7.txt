1. Basic prompt for ChatGPT to make the code

Write me the python script to do the following task :

1. Move files from source directory to target directory. The source and target directory are specified in "ckdmove.cfg"
2. The move operation run every xxx second. The second also specified to "ckdmove.cfg"

2. Since Python 3.7 is the last version fully compatible with Windows 7. We need to download and install it.

https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-379/

3. Go to installed directory and make the environment in Python 3.7

cd C:\Users\u\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37
python -m venv py37env

Note : We need to make the Environment only once, but before using it we need to activate this environment everytime.

4. Activate the Environmant

py37env\Scripts\activate

5. Install necessary Python library for our program
pip install auto-py-to-exe

6. Run the program to compile Python to .exe
auto-py-to-exe

7. After the program run, select the option "One File" and "Window Based (hide the console)"

Also set the location of output .exe file in "Settings > Output Directory"
